# AstroCart
Astrophysical Cartography (AstroCart) is a package that can produce RMS, excitation temperature, column density, mass surface density, and CO Depletion maps. It also has a spectrum and map plotting tool, which can be put into interactive mode to easily change the vmin and vmax of the base image and overlay varying levels of contours from another image.
