# AstroCart
Astrophysical Cartography (AstroCart) is a package that can produce RMS, excitation temperature, column density, 2D, mass surface density, and CO Depletion maps. It also has a spectrum and map plotting tool, which can be put into interactive mode to easily change the vmin and vmax of the base image and overlay varying levels of contours from another image. All images should be in fits format. 

## Installation
- Git Clone this repository
- navigate to the AstroCart directory
- pip install -e. 

## Mapping
The following will introduce what each main feature of the mapper code does 

### Pixel Regridding:
Regrids a fits image to a template fits imageâ€”both of which are input by the user. In addition to regridding to the same RA/DEC, this function will also regrid dimensions of the input data to the template data.
- N.B. the template image should be the one with the worst resolution of the two data sets

### RMS Map: 
Produces a 2D RMS map, given the 3D cube of data

### Excitation Temperature Map: 
Produces a 3D cube of excitation temperature, taking values only over 3rms at each position-position-velocity (or frequency) element. This excitation temperature mapper requires the user to have two different transitions of the same CO isotopologue, e.g. 13CO(J=1-0) and 13CO(J=2-1). 
- N.B. the user is required to have the following variables defined before running excitation temperature and column density map. These can be either googled or found at [Spatalogue](https://splatalogue.online//) 
   - B = rotational constant for the CO isotopologue
   - h = planck's constant
   - k = boltzmann constant
   - c = speed of light
   - Tbkg = cosmic microwave background temperature
   - freq10 = frequency of first transition
   - Aul10  = einstein coefficient of first transition
   - gup10  = the statistical weight (or degeneracy) of the upper transition of the second transition
   - Elow10 = the energy of the lower state of the first transition
   - freq21 = frequency of second transition
   - Aul21  = einstein coefficient of second transition
   - gup21  = the statistical weight (or degeneracy) of the upper transition of the second transition
   - Elow21 = the energy of the lower state of the second transition

### Column Density Map:
Produces a 3D cube of column density, which the user can choose to produce in the optically thin or non-optically thin regime.
- N.B. the column density calculations in the non-optically thin regime corrects for optical depth but does NOT correct for opacity.  

### 2D Maps:
Produces a 2D map from a 3D cube. The 2D collapse of the 3D excitation temperature map is weighted with the column density map.
- N.B. to sum over the 3D data cube and produce a 2D map, put the data cube in for the Ncol argument
- N.B. to produce a weighted 2D map from two 3D cubes of data, put the data you want to collapse in the tempMap argument with the weight in the Ncol argument. 

### Mass Surface Density Map:
Produces a mass surface density map for the input 2D column density map. 
- N.B. this currently works for only 13CO and C18O

### CO Depletion Map:
Produces a CO Depletion map from a 2D mass surface density map produced with CO and a known mass surface density map produced through some other method e.g. a Herschel mass surface density map.



## Plotting
The following will introduce what each main feature of the plotter code does 

### Spectrum:
Produces a spectrum from a 3D cube of data with km/s on the x-axis

### Map_Plot:
Produces a plot of any 2D map with the option to add a colorbar, contours, and more. 

### Interactive:
Produces an interactive map of 2D data with a contour plot overlay. The user is able to vary the minimum and maximum value on their contour levels using 'Cont Max' and 'Cont Min' as well as the vmin and vmax of their base image using 'Mean' and 'Scale'.
